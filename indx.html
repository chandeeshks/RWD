              <div>A sentence is typically associated with a clause, and a clause can be either a clause simplex or a clause complex. A clause is a clause simplex if it represents a single process going on through time, </div>
              <div>and it is a clause complex if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.</div>

                <div>A clause (simplex) typically contains a predication structure with a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of phrases (such as gerund phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted. In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of boiling is in square brackets. There is clause embedding in the second and third examples.</div>

            <div>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). 
              Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, 
              particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
